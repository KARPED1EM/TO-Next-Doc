It was born just to help my friend solve a small bug in TOH. Since then, I have explored C#, Unity and various related knowledge from scratch. In the end, not only was this small bug solved, but a new mod based on TOH was born. It&#39;s called Town Of Host Edited.</p><p>In the next six months, as my skill continued to improve, TOHE became the most popular host-only mod of AmongUs in the world. But since I was already in grade 12 and had to spend more time studying, I stopped the development of TOHE.</p><p>Later, many developers took over TOHE and continued to maintain and update it. Now they are becoming more and more complete and nicely. But there are still some players who prefer to use TOHE, so I decided to use my free time and part of my money to continue maintaining this mod. And it was renamed Town Of Next.</p><p>Not gonna lie, I am very glad that you guys can support TONX! If you can, post more TONX videos on the video platform, I will be really happy.</p><h2 id="feedback-contact-me" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#feedback-contact-me" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Feedback &amp; Contact Me</h2><p><strong>If you encounter problems or have any comments during use, the following is how to contact me:</strong></p><p>My Discord: <strong>karped1em</strong></p>',8),p={href:"https://github.com/KARPED1EM/TownOfHostEdited",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"};function u(g,f){const t=a("ExternalLinkIcon");return s(),r("div",null,[c,h,m,e("p",null,[o("Of course, you can also post suggestions or feedback on the "),e("strong",null,[e("a",p,[o("Github"),i(t)])]),o(" Issue page.")])])}const y=n(l,[["render",u],["__file","About.html.vue"]]);export{y as default};
