To all of our players,

The existence of TOHE is fleeting. In less than half a year, we started from scratch and became a well-known mod with tens of thousands of players(Most of them are in China). I also went from not knowing C# at all to now having a place in the developer circle. Thank you for your trust and support to TOHE.

But all good things come to an end. Since I made mod for learning, it is destined that TOHE will not exist for a long time like other mods. In the past six months, developing, testing, emergency repairing, feedback and communication with domestic and foreign players, and conflict resolution between developers have consumed too much time and energy for me, and let me a player who often plays TOH become a developer who hardly plays AU.

Therefore, we have to decide that TOHE will completely stop updating and maintaining in v2.3.6, and stop updating check, EAC, TOHE-Chan and other services.

In the end, thank you again for your company, and see you again.
