### <font color=red>Butcher</font>

This animation cannot be skipped and cannot participate in the meeting normally during this period. In addition, if the Butcher kills the Avenger, the Avenger will revenges everyone in anger.

This role may cause serious lag to the host when activating the skill, please enable it with caution.

### <font color=red>Stealer</font>

Only Impostor other than Bombers and Booby Traps will become Stealer. Every time a Stealer kills a person, he gets an additional vote (the vote number is set by the host, and the decimal is rounded down). Also, extra votes from the Stealer are hidden during meeting.

### <font color=#3a648f>Schizophrenic</font>

Neutrals and Madmates can't become Schizophrenic. Schizophrenic will be considered as 2 players in the game (not applying to meeting votes). Having at least one player as Schizophrenic won't end the game if there are only them and the Impostor left.
